# VMware 

So at first you should download VMWare Player 17 on your Windows or Linux Computer. 
VMware Player is a hypervisor allowing us to use virtiualization software, basically it lets you runs machines, or images inside your computer. So you are running an operating system inside your operating system and they are working sepeartly so we do not affect the main computer. 

Follow [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEEMKwqD7Yk) to download VMware player on your home computer. Make sure you computer has the proper requirements to download the software. 

Now to use virtual machines, we will provide you with virtual machines to use but here are where you can download Linux and Windows images to use on VMWare Player 
These are all the most recent versions of the product, if you want an older version, just google to find the specific version or ask us. 

[Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) - Beginner friendly 

[Debian](https://www.debian.org/) - Main Branch for Ubuntu, widely used

[Alma](https://almalinux.org/)

[Rocky](https://rockylinux.org/download)

[Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/workstation/download) - also appered in cyberpatriot 

[CentOS](https://www.centos.org/download/#sources) - used in some comps

[Arch](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/arch-boxes/-/packages/1375) - really customizable

[Kali](https://www.kali.org/) - the hacking OS 

[Parrot](https://parrotlinux.org/download/) - another hacking OS but is more privacy based

# Capture the Flags Resources

Capture the flags are a fun way to learn hard and convulated cyber security skills through creative challanges. The main one that you should start off with is [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.org/). Create an account and then start practicing! That is all I will leave you with since you are supposed to go into this blind. 

note: I recommend getting familiar with kali linux and learning how to use its tools as it will help alot with downloading tools and completing the challenge.

# Learning Linux 

So to learn Linux(the best OS) honestly just start doing it, it is definetly going to be hard to get used to but by doing you will learn far more than trying to read about it and never actually attempting to learn how Linux works. Again, 90% of computers use a version of Linux, if you continue in tech YOU WILL ENCOUNTER LINUX, learn it.

# Scripting

So scripting is going to be key to doing anything for cyberpatriot, other cybersecurity competitons, and anything system based. This section will cover scripting with BASH and Powershell but you can script in any programming language you want. I would use Go or Python for bigger secuirty tools or personal projects etc (will cover in the programming section) and Rust or C/C++ for system level or near system level programs, but for our purposes BASH (Linux) and Powershell (Windows) are going to be used. 

Basically, scripting is just a way to communicate with the computer to execute desired program such as finding the time, changing permissions, finding info on X, etc. These scripts can get pretty complex but overall well worth using after building and throughly testing as they make your life so much easier. 

Script whatever you want that you think will speed up your process and not blow up the machine, ex: applying kernel level parameters, this is dangerous and could break your machine if done incorrectly, but the mass applying of tedious commands is well worth it. An example of what not to script would be configuring in depth SQL as SQL databases could change depending on the system and this will casue you to break the database or lose points. (Basically configuring services on an in-depth level not worth it, applying their basic security commands though, absoultely) 

Now thats out of the way heres how to script in BASH: 

 - Note: scripting is just terminal commands with the added functionality of differnt programming conecepts such as functions, loop, algorithms, data structures and more. Anything that you do in a BASH script or Powershell script can be done by hand. 

## BASH ##

# Hacking Resources :) 

To do good you must know evil. Honestly hacking is one, pretty amazing and a lot of fun, two, you will lean invaluable skills that will help you on a path to becoming a penetration tester or red team member. Lastly, just knowing how to do these attacks will help you secure your computer, network, system, hardware, etc more effectively, as well as actively respond to red team attacks when doing some of the more advanced competitions. Almost all red team activities are done on Linux, specifically Kali Linux or Parrot Linux. 

TryHackMe also has red team and penetration testing courses that will really help you in learning.
[Here](https://tryhackme.com/r/hacktivities)

HackTheBox is also another great resource that will help practice live red team challenged with images etc, its a gamified way to learn hacking pretty neat. 
[here](https://www.hackthebox.com/)

HackerSploit is a youtuve channel that covers so much stuff with red teaming and hacking that you can find almost anything on there. He also explains things in a easy to understand way.
[here](https://www.youtube.com/HackerSploit/playlists)

crow is another youtuber I like a lot as he coveres a lot of concepts that relate to malware analysis and malware development. You shoudl be able to jump off what he talks about in his videos and find more advanced techniques to making or analyzing malware. 
[here](https://www.youtube.com/@crr0ww/playlists)

Nielsen Networkign help me learn hacking tools like Nmap to map and understand what is going on in a network as well as its vulnerablities, super good resource to learning tools that are present in Kali.

# Programming 

Programming allows you to make more complex programs, tools, apps, etc, because they have more functionality and can run on basically any system that has a compiler or is web-based without needed the actual OS to run. Programming Languages also have more support, are tailored to a sepcific function like Python and its Librairies, Go and its ease of use, Javascript and its many frameworks for web development, so on and so forth. Langauages are tools know how to use 1 or 2 pretty well and then use the rest when necessary. 
Also build fun stuff in your free time, anything that comes to mind do it. Maybe make some tools for this competition :3. Projects are the way to learn, develop your own projects and you will learn a lot faster than if you did not. 

[Download VS Code and heres a tutorial to VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics)

## Python ##

For Python I would start off with CS50 course and then just do some basic google searches on how to program tools for the operating system and stuff (basically the libraries) 
There will be some data analysis and AI/ML stuff in here because that is what I like to do defintely not needed or used for CyberPatriot though. 

[here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/) 

do this course and then start programming on your own :) 

[AI/ML and datascience community | Kaggle allows you to basically learn and code AI's](https://www.kaggle.com/)

Some libraires to use in python for AI are Numpy, MathPlotLib, Pandas. 
Some AI Frameworks to use are Pytorch and TensorFlow 


## JavaScript ## 
This is THE web development language it has many intricries and used to set up websites and basically everything on the internet that you see (the front-end) as well as handle some API connections to and from the back-end. Learning the basics will be good as this is a big attack vector and can be exploited really easily if you do not securely program or some settings are just misconfigured. 

The odin project teachs you from nothing to full stack web development. 
[Here](https://www.theodinproject.com/)


## Go ##

Go is used be big tech companies and more because Go ensures that your toolbox is compilable across all platforms and on all hardware, as well as, having high modularity, security, and simplicity.

[tour of the go language](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1)
[Actually programming in go docs](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go)

## Rust ##
Rust is the new system level programming langauge that is now being adopted due to how the program handles memory in a more secure way compared to C and C++. Memeory leaks, binary exploitation, and anything running on the systesm level is prone to being an attack vector. Using Rust will help you program on the system level in a secure manner as it limits alot of the human error in programming when handling memory.

[Rustlings course (learn how to use Rust)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/)

## C# ##

Used a ton to make games, if you want to do game development or make a game of your own definetly like into C# and Game engines like Godot or Unreal to make your very own game. 

[Program a simple RPG in C#](https://scottlilly.com/learn-c-by-building-a-simple-rpg-index/)
for more in depth games, use game engines like Godot or Unreal, to learn them just youtube and watch some tutorials. 

## C++ ##
Used to program fast, high-performance low level applications. Bascially it is EVERYWHERE. 

[C++ Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dudnM48yfGUldqGD0S4FFb)

## C ##

C is like old and has not changed much, like C++ is it everywhere but actually this time, its consistent, and doesnt change. It is everywhere, plus you can make some pretty nice malware on the system level with C, C++ and Rust. 

[C Course](https://www.learn-c.org/)

## Kotlin ##
This is a Java like language that is used to develop apps on android devices. 

[Kotlin Projects](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/getting-started.html#create-your-powerful-application-with-kotlin)

## Swift ## 
This is Apple's programming language that is used to develop anythin in the Apple ecosystem.

[Developing in Swift](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/develop-in-swift)

## SQL ## 
There are many types of SQL databases as well as NoSQL but in general, SQL runs all databases around the world because of how it handles data and can be configured. Examples would be MySQL, PostgreSQL, ScallaDB ( this is what Discord uses) and more.

[basics of SQL](https://sqlbolt.com/)

# Git and Github 

Git and GitHub are tools widely sued by all cybersecurity specialsists, software developers and more. this is due to the fact that both of these contribute to the Version Control System, allowing people to collabortively store and work on code, see in depth changes, review code, and make test branches of the main code without messing up the main project. Overall, you will encounter Git and GitHub and they are amazing tools you should learn. 

[Heres a tutorial on Git and GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk&t=1546s&pp=ygUcZ2l0IGFuZCBnaXRodWIgZnVsbCB0dXRvcmlhbA%3D%3D)

# Baselining and STIGS

Baselining is important as it bascially checks your system and goes, "hey how are you different from default or secure settings." Developing baseline scripts will overall make finding about 40-50% of points/vulnerabilities so much easier SO DO IT. 

Note on Baselining for Linux: 

use third party tools and system package utilities to flag what files’ default content has been changed. scan for permission issues by comparing a list of world-writable files on a clean system to the one on the challenge image, flagging any differences. This can be extended to other possible permission issues like SUIDs. There are countless other parts of the system that can be baselined, such as default systemd units, scheduled jobs, processes, and more. By baselining in the first hour, you will get a good understanding of what is actually wrong with the system.
