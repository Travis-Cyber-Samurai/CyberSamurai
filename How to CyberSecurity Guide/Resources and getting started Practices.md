# Step By step on different things to learn :)

#VMware 

So at first you should download VMWare Player 17 on your Windows or Linux Computer. 
VMware Player is a hypervisor allowing us to use virtiualization software, basically it lets you runs machines, or images inside your computer. So you are running an operating system inside your operating system and they are working sepeartly so we do not affect the main computer. 

Follow [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEEMKwqD7Yk) to download VMware player on your home computer. Make sure you computer has the proper requirements to download the software. 

Now to use virtual machines, we will provide you with virtual machines to use but here are where you can download Linux and Windows images to use on VMWare Player 
These are all the most recent versions of the product, if you want an older version, just google to find the specific version or ask us. 

[Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) - Beginner friendly 

[Debian](https://www.debian.org/) - Main Branch for Ubuntu, widely used

[Alma](https://almalinux.org/)

[Rocky](https://rockylinux.org/download)

[Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/workstation/download) - also appered in cyberpatriot 

[CentOS](https://www.centos.org/download/#sources) - used in some comps

[Arch](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/arch-boxes/-/packages/1375) - really customizable

[Kali](https://www.kali.org/) - the hacking OS 

[Parrot](https://parrotlinux.org/download/) - another hacking OS but is more privacy based 



Windows Server VMs:

[Windows Server 2014](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15ZlhfcHLvO0EhsJPaj3CBt9vTAcdz_0N/view?usp=sharing)

[Windows Server 2016](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kKYo8C_T0Xs4d_lZWpu-OO1ApYWcenUu/view?usp=sharing)

[Windows Server 2019](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yxeHNphxZwmdMr_FFPS08XkvLy1i_a7I/view?usp=sharing)

Default credentials for Server VMS:

# Capture the Flags Resources

Capture the flags are a fun way to learn hard and convulated cyber security skills through creative challanges. The main one that you should start off with is [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.org/). Create an account and then start practicing! That is all I will leave you with since you are supposed to go into this blind. 

note: I recommend getting familiar with kali linux and learning how to use its tools as it will help alot with downloading tools and completing the challenge.

# Cyber Patriot Curriculum 

Not mine but the resources are good you should know all of this stuff that is linked here for the competition.

note: Not all of it but for your specific target of security, or all of it, up to you.

# Learning Linux 

So to learn Linux(the best OS) honestly just start doing it, it is definetly going to be hard to get used to but by doing you will learn far more than trying to read about it and never actually attempting to learn how Linux works. Again, 90% of computers use a version of Linux, if you continue in tech YOU WILL ENCOUNTER LINUX, learn it. 

[Start off with Linux Journey:](https://linuxjourney.com/)

[then TryHackMe Courses](https://tryhackme.com/module/linux-fundamentals) 

[To get even mroe familar with the Linux terminal do OvertheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/)

At this point you can do the practice images, start scripting everything :3

While at this stage PLEASE PLEASE, research what you dont know using google, StackOverFlow, and more. YOU WONT KNOW EVERYTHING SO PLEASE CONTINUE LEARNING. 

[Do NCAE Videos to get a more advanced grasp of Linux](https://www.ncaecybergames.org/tutorials/)

[As well as follow these videos when learning concepts]() 



# Learning Windows 

[To learn Powershell on Windows do UndertheWire](https://underthewire.tech/century)

[Windows AD Basics](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/winadbasics)

# Learning Cisco 

# Scripting

# Hacking Resources :) 

# Programming 

# Git and Github 

Git and GitHub are tools widely sued by all cybersecurity specialsists, software developers and more. this is due to the fact that both of these contribute to the Version Control System, allowing people to collabortively store and work on code, see in depth changes, review code, and make test branches of the main code without messing up the main project. Overall, you will encounter Git and GitHub and they are amazing tools you should learn. 

[Heres a tutorial on Git and GitHub]()

# Baselining and STIGS

Baselining is important as it bascially checks your system and goes, "hey how are you different from default or secure settings." Developing baseline scripts will overall make finding about 40-50% of points/vulnerabilities so much easier SO DO IT. 

Note on Baselining for Linux: 

use third party tools and system package utilities to flag what filesâ€™ default content has been changed. scan for permission issues by comparing a list of world-writable files on a clean system to the one on the challenge image, flagging any differences. This can be extended to other possible permission issues like SUIDs. There are countless other parts of the system that can be baselined, such as default systemd units, scheduled jobs, processes, and more. By baselining in the first hour, you will get a good understanding of what is actually wrong with the system.
