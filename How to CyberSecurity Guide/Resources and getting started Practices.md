# Step By step on different things to learn :)

#VMware 

So at first you should download VMWare Player 17 on your Windows or Linux Computer. 
VMware Player is a hypervisor allowing us to use virtiualization software, basically it lets you runs machines, or images inside your computer. So you are running an operating system inside your operating system and they are working sepeartly so we do not affect the main computer. 

Follow [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEEMKwqD7Yk) to download VMware player on your home computer. Make sure you computer has the proper requirements to download the software. 

Now to use virtual machines, we will provide you with virtual machines to use but here are where you can download Linux and Windows images to use on VMWare Player 
These are all the most recent versions of the product, if you want an older version, just google to find the specific version or ask us.

# Capture the Flags Resources

Capture the flags are a fun way to learn hard and convulated cyber security skills through creative challanges. The main one that you should start off with is [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.org/). Create an account and then start practicing! That is all I will leave you with since you are supposed to go into this blind. 

note: I recommend getting familiar with kali linux and learning how to use its tools as it will help alot with downloading tools and completing the challenge.
