# How to get started with CyberPatriot. 

So this is going to be a little intro guide to getting started with not only cyberpatriot, but key concepts in cybersecurity and computer science that will be transferable to many other fields. Hope this information is helpful :) 

# Preface
Hi, my name is Daniel, known online as "Mambo" and sometimes Kitan. I have been competing in CyberPatriot for 2 years now and started at a school that did not have CyberPatriot till my sophmore your of high school, where we became a platinum competeting team and would be able to compete along side college students at CCDC, a Cyber Defense competition against active red team members. I have a deep passion and focus for computer science, and software and AI/ML development as well as, an interest in red teaming and cybersecurity. I hope that the following information can help whoever is reading this become successful in taking on the daunting task of learning Cybersecurity in CyberPatriot on onwards. 

# What is CyberPatriot ? 
Clearly defining cyber patriot and the competition is going to be very important to your success with developing what the competition is trying to teach everyone: a high school incident response and remediation competition that tests your understanding of "The Security MindSet" and how you respond to challenges.
