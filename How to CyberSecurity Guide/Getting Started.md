# How to get started with CyberPatriot. 

So this is going to be a little intro guide to getting started with not only cyberpatriot, but key concepts in cybersecurity and computer science that will be transferable to many other fields. Hope this information is helpful :) 

KEY NOTE: 

You will struggle and be googling and researching a lot, it is just apart of being apart of tech so becoming a self learner is extremely important to your overall success. 

# Preface
Hi, my name is Daniel, known online as "Mambo" and sometimes Kitan. I have been competing in CyberPatriot for 2 years now and started at a school that did not have CyberPatriot till my sophmore your of high school, where we became a platinum competeting team and would be able to compete along side college students at CCDC, a Cyber Defense competition against active red team members. I have a deep passion and focus for computer science, and software and AI/ML development as well as, an interest in red teaming and cybersecurity. I hope that the following information can help whoever is reading this become successful in taking on the daunting task of learning Cybersecurity in CyberPatriot on onwards. 

# What is CyberPatriot ? 
Clearly defining cyber patriot and the competition is going to be very important to your success with developing what the competition is trying to teach everyone: a high school incident response and remediation competition that tests your understanding of "The Security Mindset" and how you respond to challenges. 

There are three sections to this introductory competition to cybersecurity: Linux, Windows, and CISCO (Networking). Linux is a operating system that is used by 90% of computers around the world. Windows and Windows Server is another operating system that is used by almost every user in the world. Lastly, Cisco sponsers this competiton so the networking trianing resources are tailored entirely towards Cisco resources and for good reason as they are a big player in the networking space.  These sections are important for everyone to know but having a deep focus in a specific area will overall be beneficial to your success in the competition. For me, I focus on Linux so this guide will provide mostly resources for Linux which I hope to expand in the future.
